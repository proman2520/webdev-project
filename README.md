# project-3

In this repository, the data folder has the necessary .csv files as well as Jupyter notebooks that manipulate the data in dataframes. 
The Flask app folder simply has the app.py file, which when run, permits the functionality of the website elements. The planning folder 
includes the contents from our proposal: a sketched-out design of the website (which we then realized) and a planning document for the 
website outline and the next steps. The SQL folder contains the ERD from QuickDBD and the SQL query used to make the table before 
uploading the .csv data. The website folder contains all of the files that make up the website. This includes all of the .html files, 
an Images folder for all of the images that are rendered on the webpages, and a static folder which has the style.css file and all of the 
JavaScript files necessary to make the website run. The HTML uses the JS file which fetches from the Flask app which is connected to the 
SQL database which gets its data from our .csv. The data travels a long way to appear on your web browser.

Best,
Andrew
